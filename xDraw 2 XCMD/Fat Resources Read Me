Making 'Safe Fat Routine Descriptors' for code resources.
Please see MixedMode.r for information about what a Safe Fat RoutineDescriptor is.

This several step process requires that you use Rez with either MPW or
ToolServer (both of which are on your CD).  

Important:  When preparing the PPC half of the fat resource, use the Code Resource
project type and the "None" header.  The "Native" header puts a routine descriptor 
at the beginning of the resource but it isn't a fat routine descriptor.  It also isn't 
safe.  A safe routine descriptor has some 68K code at the beginning that tests the 
environment to see if it is safe to execute PPC code without crashing and then 
executes the proper code resource.  You want to create a stripped down code 
resource without a routine descriptor.  Rez will then take the 'safe' 68K code, 
a routine descriptor which has routine records for both resources, the 68K resource 
and the PPC resource and then combines them into a code resource of the desired type 
and ID.  See NIM "PowerPC System Software" for what a private resource is.  
 
1.  Compile the projects XCMD68K_C.π and XCMDPPC_C.π.  You will note that the 
	project type for XCMDPPC_C.π is Code Resource and the header type is "None".  
	Two output files are created:  68K Resource and PPC Resource.
	
2.	You know need to get the hex version of your main entry's ProcInfoType.  The easy
	way is disassemble the PPC source code that contains the variable __procinfo.
	The dump window will show you the proper value.  Alternatively, you can
	open the project ProcInfo.π found in "-CW Code Resource Info:__procinfo:".  
	It will help you to determine the correct value for the ProcInfo field of the 
	Rez file "FatCodeResource.r". Hint:  it is 0xC0.
		
4.	Use Rez again to make the safe fat code resource from PPC Resource and 
	68K Resource.  Set the directory to "Code Resource Examples:XCMDs:Fat C XCMD" and paste 
	this into your worksheet:
	rez -a FatCodeResource.r -o "AppleEvent Stack" 
	Select the entire line and press either the Enter key by itself or Command-Return.
	
5.	Run AppleEvent Stack and Stderr. Click the Press here button.

6.  If you want a fat resource instead of a safe fat resource (a fat resource
	will crash on a 68K machine--a safe fat one won't crash), change 
	FatCodeResource.r all instances of 'sdes' to 'fdes'.
